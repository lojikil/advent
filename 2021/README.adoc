== Overview

Problems from 2021's Advent of Code, and some thoughts therein

=== Building

You'll need:

- OCaml
- ReasonML CLI (at least)

and then building is as simple as `+dune b --root .+`

== Problem One

* I could have made this more functional; reading in the whole set and iterating there would have been easy enough
* Same goes for the second part: I could have read in the entire set and then just iterated in threes over it
* I may try this as well and see if I can get the correct parts with a more functional codebase 
* `+dune exec bin/one/one.exe data/one/test1+`
* `+dune exec bin/onep2/onep2.exe data/one/test1+`

== Problem Two

* Would have been interesting as a Module or the like that handled things
* Obviously, a simple tail recursive function would have been easy too
* but a Monad could be neat as well; it's just a Command monad, right?
* `+dune exec bin/two/two.exe data/two/test1+`
* `+dune exec bin/twop2/twop2.exe data/two/test1+`

== Problem Three

* **Really** dislike bit fiddling in OCaml
* I also forgot to reset the value of `+cont+` in between my loops
* `+dune exec bin/three/three.exe data/three/test1+`
* `+dune exec bin/threep2/threep2.exe data/three/test1+`
