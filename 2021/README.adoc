== Overview

Problems from 2021's Advent of Code, and some thoughts therein

== Problem One

* I could have made this more functional; reading in the whole set and iterating there would have been easy enough
* Same goes for the second part: I could have read in the entire set and then just iterated in threes over it
* I may try this as well and see if I can get the correct parts with a more functional codebase 

== Problem Two

* Would have been interesting as a Module or the like that handled things
* Obviously, a simple tail recursive function would have been easy too
* but a Monad could be neat as well; it's just a Command monad, right?
