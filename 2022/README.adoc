= Advent 2022

I'm going it again in Reason, although I'll probably try my hand at coastML as well

== Day one

. part one: simple accumulation loop
. part two:
.. modify it to output the accumulations
.. `onep2.exe | grep -E '^accum' | sort`
.. `expr top1 + top2 + top3`

== Day Two

. part one: simple `play` lambda that plays hands of RPS
. part two: new lambda to rewrite input and then `play` the hand based on the strategic advice
