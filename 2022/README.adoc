= Advent 2022

I'm going it again in Reason, although I'll probably try my hand at coastML as well

I definitely can rewrite most of these to be more _functional_, carrying less state around & avoiding `Stream.iter`, but
also I'm relatively comfortable with the style...

== Day one

. part one: simple accumulation loop
. part two:
.. modify it to output the accumulations
.. `onep2.exe | grep -E '^accum' | sort`
.. `expr top1 + top2 + top3`

== Day Two

. part one: simple `play` lambda that plays hands of RPS
. part two: new lambda to rewrite input and then `play` the hand based on the strategic advice

== Day Three

. part one: slice strings in half, find the matching value in both containers
. part two: group elves together, and do a few folds over sorts to reduce the groups nicely
