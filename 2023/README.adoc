= 2023

I started in C this year, mostly because I actually did this on my work laptop and was too lazy to setup Reason again..

== Day One:

- part 1: test values in an array for digits, sum them
-- this actually started out way more complex, but then I simplified the logic and it was straight forward.
- part 2: brute force scanning for number words over the set
-- if we have a digit, stop
-- if we have a word, stop
-- else move to the next position
